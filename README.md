## ðŸ”§ Technical Details
SectionSeeker AI adopts an `embedding search technique` utilizing the `text-embedding-ada-002` model from OpenAI. It further integrates the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model for `AI-driven filtering` during its learning journey. Such an approach empowers users to converse in natural language, breaking free from traditional tool constraints, like the `"find"` feature in standard browsers.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

### **Step 0**: Document Preprocessing

- **Section Demarcation**: SectionSeeker AI predominantly uses heading styles for section identification. It harnesses the power of GPT to further refine and categorize large sections into sub-sections.
- **Efficiency in Heading Styles**: Only a select number of heading styles need to be applied for optimal performance. However, it's noteworthy that enhancing the document with additional heading styles accelerates the SectionSeeker AI's processing speed.
- **Performance Metrics**: As a benchmark, the example `.docx` file provided in the Quick Start sectionâ€”with around 4,000 words and appropriate formattingâ€”takes under 15 seconds for processing.
- **Heading Style Recognition**: SectionSeeker AI recognizes lines as section headings if they employ Microsoft Word styles containing the terms "**Headings**" or "**SubTitle**". Below is an illustrative example of styles that SectionSeeker AI classifies as a heading:

### **Step 1**: Quick Start
- Log in using the account details provided in the Quick Start section.

### **Step 2**: Accessing Contents
- Navigate to the contents page by clicking on "Contents" in the top navigation bar.

### **Step 3**: Managing Documents
1. Create a new folder.
2. Select a folder and upload a single document.
3. After uploading, view your processed documents by selecting "Documents" on the same Contents page.

### **Step 4**: Using Chat
1. Navigate to the chat page by clicking on "Chat" in the top navigation bar.
2. Select one or multiple documents to pose questions.
3. Click on "Ask" to submit your question or press "Enter"
4. SectionSeekerAI will return the 5 most relevant sections. Each result will include:
   - The section name (indicating the document it originates from and its respective section name).
   - A relatedness score (in percentage).
   - The actual text from the section identified by SectionSeeker AI.


## Limitations of SectionSeeker AI for Documents

Please note the following constraints when using SectionSeeker AI:

- **Development Stage**: As SectionSeeker AI is still in its early development stages, it currently supports only `.docx` file types.
  
- **Document Complexity**: The tool may not function optimally with `.docx` files containing images or intricate structures. It is best suited for plain text documents. This is ideal for business-related documents like company handbooks or business agreements, which usually have a straightforward format.
  
- **Styles Dependency**: SectionSeeker AI primarily uses heading styles to demarcate sections. If a `.docx` file has pre-existing styles that aren't correctly assigned, the tool might still process the document, but there might be unintended segmentations. For instance, what should be a single section might be split into two. As a result, when users search for specific sections based on queries, the returned results might not be entirely accurate.

To achieve the best results, ensure your document adheres to the guidelines and is compatible with the tool's current capabilities.
