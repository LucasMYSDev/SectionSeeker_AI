## ðŸ”§ Technical Details
SectionSeeker AI adopts an `embedding search technique` utilizing the `text-embedding-ada-002` model from OpenAI. It further integrates the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model for `AI-driven filtering` during its learning journey. Such an approach empowers users to converse in natural language, breaking free from traditional tool constraints, like the `"find"` feature in standard browsers.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

### **Step 0**: Preparing Your Document

- **Section Identification**: SectionSeeker AI primarily identifies sections through heading styles, but it also uses GPT to categorize larger sections into sub-sections.
- **Optimal Heading Styles**: For the best results, apply only essential heading styles. However, enriching the document with additional styles improves the AI's processing speed.
- **Performance Insight**: As a reference, a `.docx` file of about 4,000 words, formatted correctly, is processed in under 15 seconds.
- **Recognizable Styles**: The AI identifies headings based on Microsoft Word styles with terms like "Headings" or "SubTitle". See the example below for clarification:

## Limitations of SectionSeeker AI for Documents

Please note the following constraints when using SectionSeeker AI:

- **Development Stage**: As SectionSeeker AI is still in its early development stages, it currently supports only `.docx` file types.
  
- **Document Complexity**: The tool may not function optimally with `.docx` files containing images or intricate structures. It is best suited for plain text documents. This is ideal for business-related documents like company handbooks or business agreements, which usually have a straightforward format.
  
- **Styles Dependency**: SectionSeeker AI primarily uses heading styles to demarcate sections. If a `.docx` file has pre-existing styles that aren't correctly assigned, the tool might still process the document, but there might be unintended segmentations. For instance, what should be a single section might be split into two. As a result, when users search for specific sections based on queries, the returned results might not be entirely accurate.

To achieve the best results, ensure your document adheres to the guidelines and is compatible with the tool's current capabilities.
