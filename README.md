## ðŸ”§ Technical Details
SectionSeekerAI adopts an `embedding search technique` utilizing the `text-embedding-ada-002` model from OpenAI.

## Limitations of SectionSeekerAI for Documents

Please note the following constraints when using SectionSeekerAI:

- **Development Stage**: As SectionSeekerAI is still in its early development stages, it currently supports only `.docx` file types.
  
- **Document Complexity**: The tool may not function optimally with `.docx` files containing images or intricate structures. It is best suited for plain text documents. This is ideal for business-related documents like company handbooks or business agreements, which usually have a straightforward format.
  
- **Styles Dependency**: SectionSeekerAI primarily uses heading styles to demarcate sections. If a `.docx` file has pre-existing styles that aren't correctly assigned, the tool might still process the document, but there might be unintended segmentations. For instance, what should be a single section might be split into two. As a result, when users search for specific sections based on queries, the returned results might not be entirely accurate.

To achieve the best results, ensure your document adheres to the guidelines and is compatible with the tool's current capabilities.
